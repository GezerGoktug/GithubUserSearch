# Github User Search üîç

**<p>In this project, I created a Github User Search site with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can find out how many followers the user entered from the input, how many people he follows, and how many repos he has. You can also look at his projects on Github by clicking on 3 prominent repos.</p>**
